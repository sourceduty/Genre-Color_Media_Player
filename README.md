Genre-Color Media Player is a Python-based media player designed to enhance your music experience by dynamically changing the background color of the application based on the genre of the song being played. The player uses metadata from audio files (such as MP3 and WAV) to identify the genre and applies a corresponding color theme, making each song feel unique as it plays. For songs that lack metadata, a random color is generated, ensuring that every song, regardless of its metadata status, has a personalized interface.

The player allows users to easily load and play songs from their file system. You can load individual music files or select entire folders to import multiple songs at once. Once the songs are loaded, the user can interact with a clean and straightforward interface that displays the title, genre, artist, and duration of each song in an organized list. The player supports basic music controls, including play, pause, stop, and volume adjustments. All controls are neatly placed for easy access, ensuring a smooth user experience.

In addition to the genre-based color customization, the application includes a logo display at the top of the window, along with the program title, "Genre-Color Media Player." The program is built using Python's Tkinter for the graphical user interface, pygame for music playback, and mutagen to read metadata from audio files. This lightweight and visually engaging media player is perfect for anyone who enjoys listening to music with a colorful and interactive interface.
